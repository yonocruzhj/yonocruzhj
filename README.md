### Introduction for GitHub Profile:
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Hadji and I'm an aspiring cybersecurity professional, currently expanding my knowledge through hands-on projects and various certifcations.

- **Network defense**: Strengthening my knowledge of network security, firewalls, and VPNs.
- **Incident response**: Practicing how to detect, investigate, and respond to security incidents.
- **Threat intelligence**: Understanding how to gather, analyze, and act on intelligence to anticipate potential attacks.
- **Risk management**: Learning to identify, assess, and mitigate security risks.

Iâ€™m excited to share my journey and projects as I build my skills and transition into the cybersecurity field. Feel free to explore my repositories and follow my progress.
